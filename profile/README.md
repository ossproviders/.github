# Welcome
OSS Providers is an open source collective that specialises in building **Pulumi and Terraform** providers for our beloved services that are currently not represented on the provider registries. We aim to help speed up the adoption IAC and to support our favorite companies by taking the lead and helping to manage the provider creation and maintainance process so they can focus building their product.

## Inspiration

Have you ever been in a situation when the OSS Pulumi or Terraform provider your production infrastructure depends on has been left for dead, no longer actively maintained, the repo threads completely stale and with no maintainers in sight?

If you ever find yourself in this situation here's a quote to lighten your day.

_"There is no old bread that cannot find its cheese."_

As this is exactly the issue we are trying to mitigate, our aim is to nurture an active OSS community of dedicated and passionate IAC provider engineers who will actively create and support many of your favorite services and companies.
